## Project Status

This project was intended to be a frontend project, utilising the UI components I created in Storybook: https://capable-stroopwafel-e97bb1.netlify.app/

Consequently, a decoupled architecture with a separate integration layer and backend are not being implemented here. The cart also has minimal functionality for this reason.

## Reflection

This was a side project that I pursued to develop my skills with React and Typescript. It uses a React component library, that I published to npm in a separate project, as the building blocks for the UI.

I used 'create-react-app' to bootstrap the project, and implemented both static and dynamic routing with React Router Dom. By adding dynamic routing to product and category pages, this project could be scaled to facilitate a larger product catalogue.
